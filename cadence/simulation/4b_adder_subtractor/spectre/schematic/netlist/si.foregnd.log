Begin Incremental Netlisting Oct 30 23:47:08 2013
WARNING (OSSHNL-274): For 'hnlMapParamFirstChar', in the last netlisting session
in this run directory, the character 
'A' was mapped to 'a'. In the current
netlisting session, no mapping rule is 
given for this character 'A'. Netlist(s)
from last session cannot be used for 
incremental netlisting. Therefore
re-netlisting the design.
